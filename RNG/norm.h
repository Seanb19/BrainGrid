  @brief Generate normally distributed random numbers

   This class allows you to create RNG objects that are
   independently seeded upon construction and return normally
   distributed random numbers.

       This function generates normally distributed random numbers
   with mean of mu and standard deviation of sigma, using the
   polar method of Marsaglia and Bray, "A Convenient Method for
   Generating Normal Variables", _SIAM Rev._, 6: 260-264 (1964).

       The algorithm is as follows:
   -# Generate two uniformly distributed numbers, U1 and U2.
      Let Vi = 2*Ui-1 for i=1,2, and let W = V1*V1 + V2*V2.
   -# If W > 1, go back to step 1.  Otherwise, let
      Y = sqrt(-2*ln(W)/W), X1 = V1*Y, and X2 = V2*Y.  Then
      X1 and X2 are normally distributed with mean of 0 and
      variance of 1.
   -# Random numbers with mean of mu and standard deviation of sigma
      are calculated by: X_prime = mu + sigma   X.

   Note that numbers are generated in pairs.  On odd-numbered calls
   to operator(), pairs are calculated.  On even-numbered calls,
   the second value is returned.
